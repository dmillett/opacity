  This is a brief summary of simple budget numbers per school and student.
  The wide range of per-student school funding is typically based on the 
  poverty level of the neighborhood attendance. For example, schools serving 
  lower income neighborhoods might receive more money per student to help provide
  more teacher assistance, while wealthier neighborhoods rely on individual donations
  + tax funding to pay their teachers.
